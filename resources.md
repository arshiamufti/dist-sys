Direct quote from this book&mdash;"*In this text I've tried to provide a more accessible introduction to distributed systems. To me, that means two things: introducing the key concepts that you will need in order to have a good time reading more serious texts, and providing a narrative that covers things in enough detail that you get a gist of what's going on without getting stuck on details.*"

This is why I like this book so much! If you're just getting started and aren't quite ready to read academic papers yet, I definitely recommend this.

Tyler's Blog posts are so good. I particularly like [this](https://bravenewgeek.com/understanding-consensus/) blog post on consensus.

* [External consistency and Spanner | Google](https://cloud.google.com/spanner/docs/true-time-external-consistency)

I like how they explain external consistency and contrast it with eventual consistency, linearizability, etc.
